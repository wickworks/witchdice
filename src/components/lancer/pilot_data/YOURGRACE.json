Her parents were HA citizens (Purview Standard); construction workers responsible for building orbital weapons of war. As a result, she has been piloting industrial machines in zero-g almost before she could walk. </p><p>- Her parents, on the cusp of being granted nobility status for their designs, encouraged her to go to an HA school for dance. While there, Jones met an exchange student and heiress of the Smith Shimano Corp named Freya and became infatuated. Through Freya, Jones took to heart ideologies which contradicted the anthrochauvinism that she had grown up with.</p><p>- This change in belief caused Jones to break from her parents, lose her scholarship, and subsequently drop out of school. Freya did not join her; Jones left HA space, smuggled through a blink gate.</p><p>- The Union Bureau of Orbital and Non-Terrestrial Management found use for Jones' skills, and signed her as a ship-breaker. She specializes in cleaning up the debris from old battlefields by removing major orbital hazards; recycling swords to plowshares.</p><p>- Jones excels in working in hot, dangerous conditions and loves seeing how far she can push her abilities. Her skill is legendary in her department of the UBO, and she has attained mech licenses and equipment roughly equivalent to a Lancer combat pilot.</p><p>- The assignment on Hercynia is fairly standard: Show up, reclaim or de-orbit large debris, and deploy nets to gradually catch the high-velocity particulates over the next few centuries. While removing the plating on a derelict cruiser in geosynchronous orbit above Evergreen, her crew's robotic drones began behaving
