# Witchdice

An elegant + powerful dice roller with tools for some specific systems.

## Dice Features

Witchdice can be used as a **general purpose roller** with easy-to-use but powerful rolling tools:

- Modifiers ("1d20 + 4")
- Negative dice ("1d20 - 2d6")
- Min/max mode ("roll 4d6, keep the 2 highest")
- Count mode ("roll 20d6, how many rolled 4 or higher?")
- Custom die types ("roll 2d13")
- Syncs rolls to [witchdice.com](https://witchdice.com/) and optionally mirrored to Discord via a bot.

It also includes a segment clock tool ("If these six segments fill, the alarm will sound.")

## Lancer Character Sheet

Witchdice has a full-fledged combat character sheet for [Lancer](https://massifpress.com/lancer):

- Imports characters from COMP/CON via json or share codes
- Beautiful butterfly-inspired mech sheet layout
- Action cheat sheet
- Rolls weapon damage, including toggles for various abilities
- GM encounter builder and NPC tracker
- Broadcast the text of systems and weapons
- See the HP, heat, and statuses of all other PCs in the squad

## Clocks

Create synced segment clocks (4, 6, 8, 10) that anyone in the room can edit, rename, or delete.

## Options

To open the options menu, click the gear icon in the extension's toolbar.
- Show or hide the clock and Lancer character sheet tabs.
- You can also disable notifications on new rolls.
