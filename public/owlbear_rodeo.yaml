# Witchdice

A cute & elegant dice roller.

**Features**

Witchdice can be used as a general purpose roller with easy-to-use but powerful rolling tools —

- Modifiers ("1d20 + 4")
- Negative dice ("1d20 - 2d6")
- Min/max mode ("roll 4d6, keep the 2 highest")
- Count mode ("roll 20d6, how many rolled 4 or higher?")
- Custom die types ("roll 2d13")
- Syncs rolls to [witchdice.com](https://witchdice.com/) and optionally mirrored to Discord via a bot.

Witchdice also has a full-fledged combat character sheet for [Lancer](https://massifpress.com/lancer).

- Imports characters from COMP/CON via json or share codes
- Beautiful butterfly-inspired mech sheet layout
- Action cheat sheet
- Rolls weapon damage, including toggles for various abilities
- GM encounter builder and NPC tracker
- Broadcast the text of systems and weapons
- See the HP, heat, and statuses of all other PCs in the squad

Finally, it includes a segment clock tool ("If these six segments fill, the alarm will sound.")

**Options**
To open the options menu, click the gear icon in the extension's toolbar —
- Show or hide the clock and Lancer character sheet tabs.
